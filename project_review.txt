1. Introduction
This document serves as a comprehensive overview of the Projects & Workshops (P&W)
Committee within IEEE@UH. It exists to formalize the systems, projects, and educational pipelines
that have been developed over the past semesters and to outline a structure that future leaders can
build upon.
The purpose is simple: to make sure that innovation, collaboration, and student creativity have a
clear home at the University of Houston.
The guiding philosophy behind everything in this document is empowerment, not competition.
IEEE@UH does not exist to outdo Robotics@UH or any other organization—we exist to amplify
what’s already possible by giving students the tools, knowledge, and community they need to
create. Our goal is to teach people how to build confidently, fail safely, and document what they
learn so others can follow.
Projects and workshops aren’t just activities; they’re the heartbeat of IEEE@UH’s technical culture,
where curiosity becomes skill, and skill becomes innovation.
Also… yeah I used AI. IT WRITES REALLY FAST and more clearly than I could ever hope to. I
just wanted to share my ideas ASAP. Ofc I screened it after.

4 / 33

2. Organizational Structure
2.1 Co-Chair
Starting Spring 2026, the Project Branch will be co-led by two chairs. The co-chair role is not
meant to divide authority, but to share stewardship. This position exists so that leadership can
scale without burning out, and so that every new idea has a second mind to test it, refine it, or run
with it.
My vision for the co-chair is that they become a trusted right-hand collaborator, someone who can
lead meetings, manage logistics, and develop their own initiatives within the P&W framework,
while still working towards goals that have already been established.
The co-chair will have full freedom to propose new projects or reshape existing systems, provided
that documentation and transparency remain intact.

2.2 Projects & Workshops (P&W) Committee
The P&W Committee is made of selected members that undergo the onboarding process to facilitate
all of our technical endeavors. We facilitate workshops, manage active projects, and ensure every
member has an accessible path from beginner to builder.
Starting next semester, we will host weekly P&W committee meetings. These are face-to-face,
casual meetups for all IEEE members to work on personal or committee projects. The time for these
meetings will be selected via the onboarding process.

Onboarding Process
Every semester, IEEE@UH will conduct a structured onboarding process for all members involved
in the Projects & Workshops Committee. The purpose of this process is to organize teams
efficiently, set clear expectations, and align meeting schedules across all active projects.
1.
The onboarding process begins with a semester kickoff form distributed to both returning
and new members. This form collects basic information such as preferred meeting times, project
interests, technical experience, and availability. Using this data, the Project Chair and Co-Chair
will determine consistent meeting times for each project team and for the general P&W Committee
meetings.
2.
For new members, the form doubles as a project-matching tool. Students who express
interest in specific areas—such as robotics, embedded systems, or circuit design—will be directed
toward projects that fit their goals and current skill levels. Returning members will have the
opportunity to stay on their existing project teams or request reassignment if they want to explore
something new.
This system creates a clean onboarding pipeline where no one “falls through the cracks,” and where
every member is attached to a tangible project from the start of the semester. It also helps balance
5 / 33

team sizes, reduce scheduling conflicts, and ensure that new projects don’t begin without sufficient
staffing.
Check out the form at this link.

Members’ Responsibilities
• Communication: All coordination happens casually in #pw-chat on Discord—if you start a
task, just drop a quick message.
• Documentation: All P&W materials will be uploaded to a central GitHub repository after I
initialize the folder structure. This ensures future officers and members can easily find,
reuse, and improve past resources.
Workshop-Specific Responsibilities
• Trial Runs: Committee members attend rehearsal sessions to learn the material and practice
troubleshooting.
• Initiative: Any P&W Member may propose their own workshops using committee
resources. The Project Chairs help polish slides, prepare materials, and assist during
delivery. To avoid fatigue, the committee emphasizes quality over quantity—a few wellrun workshops per month are better than a cluttered schedule.
• Members may also assist with existing workshops—helping refine slides, update
materials, or improve overall quality—provided they keep an active communication
channel open with the project co-chairs. Authorization is quick and flexible; just ask
before starting. Terms of approval are handled on a case-by-case basis.

Subteam Breakdown and Responsibilities
• Workshop Team: Act as on-site program assistants for technical workshops, and
maintains both the presentation slides and shared BOM + reimbursement sheets. All
workshop materials will be uploaded to a central GitHub repository after I initialize the
folder structure. This ensures future officers and members can easily find, reuse, and
improve past resources. For more on workshops, see Section 4.
• Collaborative and Continuous Project Teams: Oversee the success of collaborative and
continuous projects, contribute to documentation on GitHub, and act as mentors for newer
members. These include our Chili Cook-off Initiative (CCO), Circuit Speed Dating (CSD),
and Energy Techathon (ET). More information on these projects, including timelines, is
detailed in Section 3.1 | Project Categories. Note that a committee member can only be in
one P&W Project Team at a time. Information on sub-team expectations, onboarding, and
leadership can be found in Section 3.2 | Project Expectations.

2.3 Relationship Between IEEE@UH and Robotics@UH
IEEE@UH and Robotics@UH share overlapping interests but approach engineering from different
angles.
Robotics@UH focuses on mechanical integration and interdisciplinary builds, employing a
broad range of toolsets from kits to high-level system assembly that emphasize mechanical design
and control structure. Their project deliverables prioritize getting functional systems up and
running.
IEEE@UH, on the other hand, specializes in the electrical and embedded foundations. Our
projects exist to help students understand the electronics behind robotics: how to select components,
design circuits, debug signals, and bridge theory with practical implementation.
Both organizations benefit from staying connected—sharing lab space, documentation practices,
and cross-promotion—but IEEE@UH’s identity will remain rooted in circuits, embedded systems,
and electronic design education. This distinction ensures that students can move fluidly between
both orgs: learning the fundamentals of electronics with IEEE@UH before applying that knowledge
in Robotics@UH’s larger mechanical or competition-based projects. The long-term goal is to
present ourselves as two arms of the same body: distinct, but mutually reinforcing.
It is here that I want to include a note about Battlebots. I propose that, under IEEE@UH, Combat
Robotics takes on a project structure similar to Micromouse. That is, members would benefit from
our recorded resources (Section 5.2) detailing electronics fundamentals and selection, and design
PCBs and communication protocols between the robot and the controller. For the continuation of
this document, I will refer to Battlebots as a proposed project under IEEE@UH.

2.4 Collaboration Framework with Other Orgs
Beyond Robotics@UH, IEEE@UH will actively collaborate with other technical and cultural
student organizations such as ASME, IEEE-NSM, AIAA, Energy Coalition, MAES, SHPE,
NSBE, SWE, SASE, and many more. The intent is not to compete with these groups, but to invite
them into our ecosystem. We will encourage these organizations to host or collaborate on
workshops or committee meetings jointly with us, providing their members with hands-on
technical experiences while giving IEEE@UH broader exposure and stronger attendance at our
events. In exchange, their members gain access to advanced technical content, and we gain
visibility and credibility as the campus hub for engineering skill-building.
While some of these orgs occasionally host technical sessions themselves, IEEE@UH focuses on
building strong electrical foundations, taught by and for students who want to learn how things truly
work. But we also believe collaboration beats rivalry. When these orgs succeed technically, the
entire UH engineering community rises with them.

Organizations can submit a collaboration/cohost request form at this link.

“Hosting With” vs. “Collaborating”
To clarify:
• Hosting With IEEE@UH means the partner organization’s name appears on promotional
materials and their officers are present during the event, often as program assistants or cofacilitators. The workshop or project meeting is primarily organized and led by IEEE@UH,
but the partnering org is encouraged to contribute in any way they can—such as booking
rooms, providing refreshments, designing flyers, or helping manage attendance.
Specific logistics will always be coordinated directly between the respective officers of each
org.
• Collaborating with IEEE@UH, on the other hand, means a true technical co-development
of the event. In this case, the respective technical officers from both organizations work
together to design and execute a brand-new workshop or initiative from the ground up—
combining resources, knowledge, and creative direction.
This distinction ensures clarity and balance: “hosting with” expands reach and engagement, while
“collaborating” deepens technical relationships and creates shared ownership of new ideas. Both
formats strengthen IEEE@UH’s network without diluting its mission or identity.
For more information on workshop criteria, please see Section 4.2 | Workshop Criteria.

3. Project Framework
Individual projects focus on personal technical growth through self-directed building,
collaborative projects emphasize teamwork and shared engineering outcomes across subteams,
and continuous projects maintain long-term engagement through recurring, community-centered
initiatives that sustain IEEE@UH’s technical culture year-round.

3.1 Project Categories
Individual Projects
Individual projects are designed to build technical confidence and creative independence. Each
member or small team takes ownership of a complete build, from design to debugging, so the
project reflects their personal interests and growth. These projects act as a low-pressure entry point
into engineering, giving students the freedom to experiment, make mistakes, and develop hands-on
intuition before moving into larger collaborative teams.
Note:
Both IEEE@UH and Robotics@UH run hands-on project meetings. I noticed two natural subtypes:
Autonomous Projects (robots that drive themselves) and Controls Projects (piloted robots).
To make our efforts cohesive, I recommend using flexible, case-by-case pairings between related
projects when their timelines or topics naturally overlap
For example, early sessions for Micromouse, Line Follower, and Battlebots could share space to
cover common fundamentals such as motors or power systems before diverging into their respective
Autonomous and Controls sessions. Similarly, when Drones and Battlebots both cover brushless
motors, piloting, or safety, joint sessions could make sense there too.
This flexible pairing structure keeps projects moving at a similar pace, reduces stagnation, and
improves overall cohesiveness,making it easier to onboard new members, explain how our projects
relate, and plan joint workshops when shared concepts arise.
Suggestions from Robotics@UH officers to realistically manage this idea are encouraged.
Micromouse - IEEE@UH | Autonomous
Started Fall 2023, inspired by Veritasium. Small teams (2-4) design a Micromouse—a maze-solving
autonomous robot using sensors and algorithms to find the shortest path.
Meetings: Fridays 4-6 PM in the communal ENGR lounge.
Format: brief circuit overview → breadboarding/debugging/programming.
Line Follower - Robotics@UH | Autonomous
Started Fall 2025. Teams (3-4) build a sensor-driven robot that follows a line smoothly.
Meetings: Wednesdays at Roy G. Cullen Building.

9 / 33

Drones - Robotics@UH | Controls
Started Fall 2025. Focus on assembling drone kits and earning pilot certification.
Meetings: Cougar Village 1.
Battlebots - IEEE@UH | Controls
Currently paused (Fall 2025) with plans to relaunch Fall 2026.
Goal: Design and assemble circuits, weapons, and a chassis for 1–3 lb battlebots.

Collaborative Projects
Collaborative projects are large-scale, interdisciplinary builds that bring together members from
both IEEE@UH and Robotics@UH under a unified objective. Each project is led by a team lead,
often supported by subteam leads who oversee specific technical domains such as mechanical
design, embedded systems, or control logic. These projects demand coordination across multiple
disciplines, so clear documentation, leadership continuity, and weekly progress syncs are essential.
Unlike individual projects, collaborative projects emphasize teamwork, long-term planning, and
alignment with external competition or showcase deadlines.
University Rover Challenge (URC) | Robotics@UH
URC is a long-term, competition-based project where students design and construct a semiautonomous rover capable of navigating simulated Martian terrain. The team includes subgroups for
mechanical design, drive systems, embedded control, and software development. This project
emphasizes project management, interdisciplinary teamwork, and system integration at a nearprofessional level.
Robot Arm Project | Robotics@UH
The Robot Arm project focuses on developing a functional robotic manipulator from scratch,
combining mechanical design, kinematics, motor control, and embedded systems. Members learn
how to synchronize hardware and firmware for smooth actuation. The project’s modular nature
makes it an ideal training ground for new members interested in robotics and automation.
Chili Cookoff Initiative | IEEE@UH Project & Workshop Committee
Every March, IEEE@UH hosts the annual Chili Cook-off. This year, we want to begin a tradition
of showcasing a technical initiative at the event. Every year, a new Chili Cook-off Initiative
should merges technical creativity with cultural engagement and highlight how IEEE@UH blends
innovation with community spirit, encouraging members to design projects that people can
physically experience. In other words, we want to demonstrate engineering in a social and
entertaining context.
This year, we want to design and assemble a touch-sensitive, music-reactive, modular
dancefloor. Project Chairs are always responsible for deciding the project and project timeline.

10 / 33

IEEE R5 Robotics Competition (Planned) | IEEE@UH Competitions Chair
The IEEE Region 5 Robotics Competition will be introduced as a future collaborative initiative
between IEEE@UH and Robotics@UH. The goal is to form a unified team to represent UH in
regional IEEE events, fostering technical excellence and recognition at the professional level. This
project will allow members to apply their skills to a standardized competition format and gain
exposure beyond campus. I recommend that the Competitions Chair begins recruiting
promising members come Spring 2026, in preparation for the R5 Conference in Spring 2027. This
effort will involve identifying promising members from individual and collaborative projects who
demonstrate leadership, creativity, and resilience under deadlines. Additionally, I recommend the
Competitions Chair builds a foundation and proposes a project timeline this year so that by next
fall, the R5 Robotics Team is fully formed, trained, and competition-ready.

Continuous Projects
Continuous projects are recurring initiatives that keep IEEE@UH active between major competition
cycles. They focus on sustained member engagement, technical outreach, and organizational growth
rather than one-time builds. Each program has leads responsible for maintaining documentation,
organizing events, and onboarding new contributors each semester to ensure long-term continuity.
These projects form the backbone of the chapter’s year-round activity, where experimentation, event
hosting, and mentorship all intersect.
Energy Techathon Team
As of November 2025, the Energy Techathon team will have three to four months to design and
execute a prototype-centered hackathon that bridges the gap between ideation and engineering.
The team should host one to two preparatory workshops focused on rapid prototyping skills such
as circuit design, embedded systems, or renewable energy modules. The workshops should prepare
participants for the full Techathon event in the spring.
The team will also be responsible for reaching out to the Energy Coalition to discuss the
hackathon proposal and ensure that the event maintains a clear technical identity distinct from EC’s
concept-based hackathon.
If the Energy Coalition raises concerns or technical questions, the team lead should either 1) ask a
Project Co-Chair for additional clarification before they respond or 2) prompt either of the Project
Co-Chairs to continue the conversation directly with any EC representatives.
Additionally, the Energy Techathon subteam will prepare an internal IEEE team to compete in EC’s
own hackathon, ensuring representation and outreach continuity.
Ideally, the Energy Techathon will be a 1-to-3 day event where participants will learn of a proposed
environmental/energy challenge and prototype a solution that applies electrical engineering.
Circuit Speed Dating
Circuit Speed Dating is an interactive, fast-paced learning series where members rotate between
short circuit-building challenges. It’s designed to help team members and participants alike to
11 / 33

quickly build familiarity with components, analog circuits, and debugging under pressure, while
making the learning process fun and social. Each event highlights a different circuit concept,
encouraging team members to learn collaboratively and test their problem-solving skills in real
time. This project has rapidly grown into one of IEEE@UH’s most engaging recurring activities,
providing a consistent entry point for new members throughout the semester. Future actionable
items include:
1. Encouraging existing CSD members to design PCBs for circuits they’ve already built or
showcased. These designs will be compiled into a “Circuit Date Bank” for reuse for
showcasing circuit demos in future events.
2. Recruiting more CSD members, with more than one person taking ownership of one
circuit. This distributes responsibility, encourages collaboration, and makes event-day
facilitation smoother and more engaging.
3. Long-term, CSD will evolve beyond isolated demos; it will showcase how multiple simple
circuits can be combined to create complex, expressive systems.

3.2 Project Expectations
Semester Timeline and Deliverables
Each project category—Individual, Collaborative, and Continuous—should maintain its own
semester timeline to keep progress measurable and visible. These timelines include milestones for
design, prototyping, testing, and final showcase or competition readiness.
Individual project leads will draft their own flexible schedules, while collaborative and continuous
project leads will coordinate shared calendars with subteams to avoid overlap and missed deadlines.
By the end of each semester, every project should have something tangible to present—whether
that’s a functioning prototype, a recorded demo, or a documented postmortem explaining lessons
learned. For each project’s timeline, see Section 3.3.

Onboarding
Individual
Onboarding for individual projects will vary at the discretion of each project lead, but all new
members should first be directed to the fundamentals and project-specific video resources
described in Section 5.2. These videos are intended to accelerate ramp-up so members can reach a
first working design or prototype as early in the semester as possible, leaving in-person meetings
focused on debugging, refinement, and deeper questions rather than reteaching the basics.
Collaborative and Continuous
I recommend that onboarding for all collaborative and continuous projects, including
Robotics@UH projects, follow an onboarding process similar to the one for P&W Committee.
Additionally, new members should be introduced to the project timeline and the project hero
video (if applicable) or something adjacent (See Section 5.2).
12 / 33

Recap of P&W Committee Onboarding Process:
1.
The onboarding process begins with a semester kickoff form distributed to both returning
and new members. This form collects basic information such as preferred meeting times, project
interests, technical experience, and availability. Using this data, the Project Chair and Co-Chair
will determine consistent meeting times for each project team and for the general P&W Committee
meetings.
2.
For new members, the form doubles as a project-matching tool. Students who express
interest in specific areas—such as robotics, embedded systems, or circuit design—will be directed
toward projects that fit their goals and current skill levels. Returning members will have the
opportunity to stay on their existing project teams or request reassignment if they want to explore
something new.
Note:
I recommend that all members starting a project, whether IEEE@UH or Robotics@UH, fill out the
P&W Onboarding Form, so that we can set our P&W Meeting Schedule to align with almost
everyone’s availability.

Documentation
Proper documentation ensures continuity between semesters and prevents knowledge loss.
• Individual Projects: Documentation is encouraged but informal—project logs, schematics,
or videos that can be shared for inspiration.
• Collaborative & Continuous Projects: I recommend all code, schematics, CAD files, and
media should be uploaded to GitHub under a linked repository. Each subteam should
maintain its own README outlining purpose, progress, and pending tasks.

Subteam Leadership
Leadership is structured to balance autonomy with accountability.
• Robotics@UH Projects: Leadership roles and officer assignments are delegated internally
by Robotics@UH.
• Individual Projects: Each project lead acts as a mentor for their group, guiding others
through design, troubleshooting, and documentation.
• Collaborative and Continuous Projects: Team leads are responsible for maintaining
forward momentum across subteams and have authority to make executive decisions if
progress stalls. If no input is being provided, leads are expected to act rather than wait.
For continuous projects, leads carry out existing initiatives while proposing new ones for
future semesters. They should ensure continuity, delegate tasks early, and mentor
replacements to avoid burnout.
I recommend that every team and subteam has a minimum of 2 leads to share the workload,
meanwhile Project Chairs and the corresponding Robotics@UH Officers provide the timeline.

3.4 Project Events
Competitions
IEEE@UH participates in and prepares for multiple competitions across project categories. Each
competition provides an external benchmark for the technical and organizational growth of our
members.
• University Rover Challenge (URC):
The University Rover Challenge is managed by Robotics@UH, with preparation and team
structure determined by that project’s lead. IEEE@UH maintains an advisory and support
role, providing electronics guidance, documentation templates, and cross-promotion
opportunities where appropriate, but does not directly oversee the build or competition
logistics.
• IEEE Region 5 (R5) Robotics Competition:
TBD By Competitions Chair.
• IEEE Region 5 (R5) Circuits Competition:
If IEEE@UH participates in the Region 5 Circuits Competition, members of the Circuit
Speed Dating and Energy Techathon subteams will receive first consideration for team
selection, in that order. These members’ experience aligns closely with the competition.
• Energy Hackathon
See Section 3.1 | Energy Hackathon.

IEEE Project Showcase
Starting next semester, IEEE@UH will host a Project Showcase every semester.
The Showcase provides recurring milestones for members to demonstrate progress, celebrate
creativity, and set goals for the following term.
• Purpose: To promote project completion within a single semester and encourage iterative
learning. For example, a student could feasibly build a Micromouse in one semester and a
Battlebot the next, gaining two major design experiences within their first year.
• Format:
• Individual Projects (Micromouse, Line Follower, Drones, Battlebots) compete in
short trials or demos.
• Collaborative Projects (Chili Cook-off Initiative, URC, Robot Arm) present large
builds and explain development progress.
• Continuous Projects (Energy Techathon, Circuit Speed Dating) exhibit
documentation, PCBs, breadboards, and ongoing initiatives.
• Recording & Continuity: All project presentations will be recorded and archived so future
members can learn from prior work rather than start from scratch.

17 / 33

Note on Personal Projects
For individual projects that are personal builds—such as small robots or custom devices—I do not
believe in mandatory project meetings. These are passion-driven endeavors and should stay
flexible.
Instead, members working on personal projects are encouraged to attend weekly P&W Committee
meetings. These meetings are member-exclusive spaces where individuals can:
• Work on committee initiatives or their own personal projects.
• Ask for feedback, design help, or troubleshooting support.
• Learn from others working on similar challenges.

18 / 33

4. Workshops Overview
4.1 Purpose of Workshops in IEEE@UH
Workshops are how IEEE@UH keeps its members learning between major projects.
They provide hands-on, low-stakes spaces where students can build technical confidence, explore
tools, and immediately apply concepts to ongoing projects.
Each workshop is designed around three core values:
1. Accessibility – new members should feel welcome regardless of prior experience.
2. Relevance – topics must tie directly into our projects or member interests.
3. Documentation – everything taught should be recorded or archived so future members can
reuse it.
Together, these workshops form the backbone of our internal education system and ensure that
every member has an on-ramp into engineering practice.

4.2 Workshop Criteria
Workshop Categories
We have 4 types of workshops:
1. Traditional – One-shot or at most two-part lecture workshops that teach participants new
skills (EDA Software, Soldering, etc...). Usually presented by the Project Chair(s).
2. shorteasyfun – One-shot project workshops focused on producing a small project within 23 hours.
3. Committee – Circuit Speed Dating Events, Energy Techathon Workshops
4. Project Series – Recurring meetings for Micromouse, Battlebots, or Robotics@UH
Projects.
“Is This a Good Fit for IEEE?”
When deciding if a topic belongs under IEEE@UH, ask three questions:
1. Technical Depth: Does it teach a hardware, software, or design skill that complements our
ongoing projects?
2. Transferability: Can members use what they learn on other builds or personal projects?
3. Sustainability: Can the material be documented or reused in the future?
If a proposed idea checks at least two of these boxes, it’s a good fit for IEEE.
Otherwise, it might be better suited as a short recorded video or a collaboration with another
organization.
19 / 33

When to Make a Video vs Host a Workshop
• Video tutorials are best for foundational or repeat topics—for example, basic PCB
workflow, installing KiCad, or Git setup. Recording these once prevents burnout from
reteaching the same material.
• Workshops are for hands-on, collaborative, or experimental sessions—anything where
live troubleshooting, peer feedback, or physical tools are required.
The long-term goal is to build a hybrid learning model: members learn the basics
asynchronously through videos, then attend workshops to apply those skills in real time.
Collaboration Criteria for Joint Workshops
IEEE@UH encourages collaboration when it strengthens content or builds inter-org relationships,
but not every topic needs a partner.
A collab is a good idea when:
• Another org brings domain expertise we lack (e.g., IEEE-NSM for scientific
programming).
• There’s a shared technical goal (e.g., ASME for 3D Slicing).
• The event provides cross-disciplinary value that reaches beyond electrical engineering.
Before confirming a collaboration, evaluate logistics, ensure shared responsibilities, and verify that
the partnership genuinely adds learning value. Workshops led with other orgs should fall into two
categories: “hosted with” or “collaborated on” (see Section 2). Hosted workshops expand audience
reach; collaborative ones develop shared technical content. In both cases, coordination and
documentation standards remain consistent with IEEE@UH’s internal expectations.
Another note about GirlIEEEs Chair:
Please reach out to SWE, Phi Sigma Rho, and similar engineering women’s empowerment orgs to
invite them to co-host workshops or project sessions with IEEE@UH.

4.5 Workshop Wishlist
HAM Radio w/ AIAA
I’d like to co-host with AIAA on one of their HAM Radio occurances that introduces IEEE@UH
members to RF and wireless engineering. After I go to one HAM Radio or two, then I can
brainstorm and discuss with them about a one-time HAM Radio occurance that IEEE can collab or
host with (maybe we could put a little twist on the event!).
This initiative would expand our curriculum into high-frequency domains and encourage students to
pursue amateur radio licensing and RF project development.

Outreach Workshops (K–12 and External Programs)
IEEE@UH’s Outreach Committee focuses on community engagement—connecting UH
engineering students with local schools and youth organizations through STEM-focused events.
While Outreach leads the communication, scheduling, and coordination with external institutions,
the Projects & Workshops Committee provides the technical backbone for these activities.
Specifically, the Workshop Subteam within P&W will assist in developing age-appropriate
workshop materials, simplified circuits, and guided activities that align with K–12 audiences.
They will also prepare documentation, supply checklists, and provide program assistants (IEEE
members trained to facilitate interactive demos safely and effectively).

Co-host Instances of Project Workshops Across Campus
For example, I know SHPE did a musical keyboard session this semester. We could ask to co-host
an instance of these Project Workshops. That way, we expand our reach.

Certification Trainings
Soldering, MATLAB (with ASME?), etc.

22 / 33

5. Educational Resources & Outreach
IEEE@UH will continue posting workshop photos and project updates across social platforms to
highlight member accomplishments and attract new participants. By maintaining a strong online
and campus presence, we position IEEE@UH not just as a student organization, but as a
recognizable community of innovators. Ultimately, this design and content strategy is about
recognition, unity, and legacy.
I hope that the Marketing Committee and Project & Workshop Committee can collaborate on
the goals I’ve outlined below:

Page on IEEE@UH Website
The P&W Page will act as the public interface of the Projects & Workshops Committee—both a
digital archive and a recruitment tool. Each active project (individual, collaborative, and
continuous) will have its own page featuring:
• A project overview and photos of current prototypes
• Links to GitHub repositories and documentation
• The names and LinkedIn profiles of team and subteam leads, so members know exactly
whom to contact (and for our hardworking members get recognition!)
This structure will make the IEEE@UH website a living portfolio instead of a static club page, and
it will help preserve continuity between generations of project teams. That is, instead of replacing
old content with each update, the P&W page should archive progress over time—using a toggle or
timeline-style menu to showcase each project’s development across semesters and years.
The following pages are a recommended UX flow (mocked on moqups.com).

24 / 33

Video Content
By combining asynchronous and in-person learning, we make engineering education more flexible
and scalable. Each video will be archived alongside written documentation so that project leads can
easily assign them as prerequisites or refreshers before builds begin.
To encourage engagement, we plan to implement small incentives—quizzes, sticker rewards, and
recognition on the IEEE website or social media. While minor, these systems reinforce consistent
participation and create positive feedback loops for members who show initiative. The goal isn’t
gamification for its own sake, but to celebrate curiosity and reward self-driven learning.

Workshop Recordings
These are uncut or lightly edited recordings of live workshops hosted by IEEE@UH. They
document student questions and live debugging. Workshop recordings also help members who
missed sessions catch up and give future leads a reference for how to host their own workshops.
25 / 33

Formal Tutorials
Short, polished instructional videos that teach specific technical tools or workflows. Topics include
(but are not limited to:) EasyEDA schematic design, Arduino IDE setup, PCB manufacturing
workflow, component sourcing, and basic embedded code structure. Unlike workshops, these
are more concise and modular—made for repeat viewing.
Note: KiCad workshops will continue in-person, since they make excellent entry points for new
members to experience IEEE culture firsthand.

Fundamentals Video Series (“Fundamentals + Project Modules”)
The core video curriculum (see previous section) teaching fundamentals like input/output logic,
analog vs digital signals, sensors, and motor control, followed by project-specific videos
(Micromouse, Battlebot, Line Follower, etc.). These form the backbone of our asynchronous
learning program and act as the official introduction for new project members.
Tentative Agenda:
1. Installing Arduino IDE
2. First Arduino IDE Programs
3. DC and Stepper Motors. (+ PID Extension)
4. Buck and Boost Converters
5. Sensors: Encoders, Infrared, IMU
6. Components: Diodes, Transistors, Switches
7. Line Follower: Assembling a Line Follower Robot
8. Micromouse: Assembling a Micromouse
9. Brushless Motors
10. Battlebot: Remote Controller with Wireless Transciever Module

Project Identity “Hero” Videos
Every project under the IEEE@UH umbrella should ultimately have its own signature video—
something that lives for a year or two before being refreshed. These videos are meant to be
immersive snapshots of what it feels like to be part of that project.
The Circuit Speed Dating video might be a first-person vlog following a new member through the
event, showing what it’s like to rotate through tables and build circuits. The Micromouse video
could follow a team from concept to competition, showing the maze trials and debugging process.
The Battlebot video could show prototypes evolving, testing footage, and commentary from the
builders themselves.
Each project should choose the format that best captures its personality—whether that’s
cinematic, tutorial-based, or documentary-style—and update it every couple of years. This gives

26 / 33

IEEE@UH a timeless visual library that future members can watch to instantly understand our
culture, workflow, and sense of play.

Inspo Posts (“Build With Me” Videos)
In addition to the official IEEE@UH videos, individual member content will be featured as part of
our storytelling ecosystem. For example, I’ll be posting videos on my personal YouTube channel
that document my own builds—such as a vlog-style series tracking the design, philosophy, and
iteration behind my battlebot. These videos, while hosted personally, will be linked on the
IEEE@UH site as official content when relevant, giving projects a human, authentic narrative.

Branding
The P&W Committee and every subteam will have its own logo, merchandise, color palette, and
typography style that fits within the larger IEEE@UH identity. The goal is for each subteam to feel
like its own micro-brand, while still being clearly part of the IEEE@UH family.
Each subteam’s merch (T-shirts, hoodies, stickers, patches, etc.) will use these logos to create a
sense of belonging and pride. This consistent branding also extends to slides, videos, and posters,
giving IEEE@UH a polished and cohesive public image.
I’ll include examples of my past design work as a freelance artist and some visual inspiration
collected online, but I recommend that we hire or collaborate with a freelance designer who can
help us refine and expand this style. Ideally, we’ll create a design toolkit—vector templates, fonts,
and guidelines—so future committees can continue the tradition without losing the look and feel we
establish now.

6. Reflection & Lessons Learned
The Fall 2025 semester marked a major step forward for IEEE@UH’s Projects & Workshops
Committee. We successfully established our core project framework, piloted a recurring workshop
cycle, and began documenting every process to make replication easier. However, as with all new
systems, there were growing pains worth reflecting on.
One major takeaway was the importance of clear pacing and realistic scheduling. Several
workshops tried to cover too much material in a single session, which diluted engagement and made
it harder for newcomers to follow. Future iterations will focus on smaller, more digestible modules
with clear takeaways.
Members appreciated hands-on activities but often needed more structured checkpoints—so we’ll
integrate short “apply this now” segments mid-workshop to maintain momentum.
Communication within the committee improved through Discord coordination, but task
accountability still needs refinement. The casual tone works, but we’ll start implementing a
lightweight tracking system to make progress visible without feeling bureaucratic (e.g. pinned
updates, short weekly summaries).
Lastly, we learned that members thrive when they see tangible outcomes. Whether it’s a finished
PCB, a blinking LED, or a GitHub repo with their name on it, visible progress directly translates
into motivation. This insight will guide how we plan next semester’s workshop cadence and project
documentation efforts.

28 / 33

7. Recommendations
The coming semester will focus on integration, sustainability, and expansion. Each project and
workshop should build upon the previous one, forming a continuous educational arc from
recruitment to mastery. Additionally, emphasis will be placed on fostering a more cohesive identity
and communication channel between IEEE@UH and Robotics@UH, ensuring both organizations
operate in sync while maintaining distinct strengths.

Integration of Workshops into the Project Pipeline
Workshops will directly support ongoing projects instead of existing as stand-alone events. For
example, a KiCad session might coincide with Micromouse PCB design week, or Git and Linux
sessions may prepare members for collaborative documentation. By linking sessions to real builds,
we reinforce both technical learning and project completion rates.

Expanding Project Domains
IEEE@UH is evolving beyond classical circuits. Future initiatives will dive into RF and wireless
communication, high-frequency design, IoT systems, and electrochemical energy projects.
These emerging areas align with student curiosity and future industry demand. The goal is to make
IEEE@UH a space where students can explore advanced topics while staying grounded in hands-on
prototyping.

Cross-Org Cohesion and Communication
A more cohesive structure between IEEE@UH and Robotics@UH will reduce redundancy, improve
scheduling, and present both as two complementary pillars of UH’s engineering community. I will
personally begin attending Robotics@UH meetings—even if just to listen or study—to stay
informed on project timelines and progress. Maintaining visibility and open communication will
ensure that both orgs can align goals, share resources, and celebrate collective success.

Infrastructure Chair and Branch
To sustain long-term efficiency, I recommend establishing an Infrastructure Chair position and a
dedicated Infrastructure Branch. This branch would attract members with systems engineering
or CIS backgrounds to design and automate IEEE@UH’s internal workflows, including but not
limited to: inventory management, documentation pipelines, website integration, membership and
attendance tracking, Discord organization, and calendar automation.
As of November 2025, a major operational goal is to build a semi-automated inventory tracker
with Google Sheets. This system will log component and material quantities, allowing us to quickly
check stock before submitting BOMs, budgets, or reimbursements. Furthermore, since he is already
working on a more sophisticated inventory tracker for IEEE@UH of his own accord, I nominate
Sergio Hernandez for the position of Infrastructure Chair.
As a whole, the IEEE Lounge should undergo organization efforts to make it more functional and
inviting. The existing Lounge Wishlist spreadsheet outlines furniture and storage upgrades. A
29 / 33

decluttered, modular workspace will make it easier to store materials, host workshops, and maintain
a consistent project environment.
Future goals may include creating an IEEE@UH web app for member RSVPs and event
calendars, or at minimum, streamlining access to .ics calendar links and Discord announcements.
This branch would serve as the technical backbone of operations, bridging the gap between
engineering and administration.

8. Closing Remarks and Immediate Next Steps
The IEEE@UH Projects & Workshops Committee exists to make engineering doable—turning
interest into initiative and initiative into real hardware. Our goal is a self-sustaining ecosystem of
learning, building, and mentorship centered on electrical and embedded design.
Starting Spring 2026, weekly P&W meetings will serve as our home base. These are casual
sessions where members work on projects, ask for help, and share progress. These meetings,
scheduled through onboarding, keep our community active, collaborative, and creative.
Our structure is simple but effective: the Workshop Team runs sessions and manages resources, the
Project Teams lead builds and documentation, and Operations & Logistics keeps our lounge and
materials organized. Together, they form a pipeline from idea to prototype to showcase.
IEEE@UH’s projects complement Robotics@UH. Robotics emphasizes interdisciplinary systems
and competitions, while IEEE@UH focuses on the electrical foundations—circuits, components,
and embedded systems. Both thrive through shared labs, mentorship, and a common goal of
advancing UH’s engineering community.
Workshops connect theory to practice through accessibility, relevance, and documentation. They
ensure every skill ties into our projects and that knowledge stays reusable for future members.
Educational outreach and video resources extend that mission by teaching the next generation while
reinforcing IEEE@UH’s culture of creativity and technical excellence.
Through structured meetings, open workshops, and collaborative projects, we’re building a lasting
community of engineers who learn, teach, and bring ideas to life.
